# <i class="fa fa-object-group"></i> JHipster IDE

JHipster IDE is an Xtext DSL which provides textual editing support of JHipster Domain Language files for popular IDEs and editors such as Eclipse and Visual Studio Code.

The following features are available:

- Syntax Coloring
- Error Checking
- Auto-Completion
- Formatting
- Hover Information
- Mark Occurences
- Go To Declaration
- Rename Refactoring
- Toggle Comments
- Outline / Structure View
- Quick Fix Proposals
- Find References
- Folding

Furthermore, JHipster IDE generates automatically an UML diagram of the JDL file and provides an integration with the Eclipse terminal shell to call JHipster's Yeoman generator.

Another nice feature is Xdocker which allows to edit, build and run Docker files and images generated by JHipster directly from the IDE.

The newest version 1.3.x is a maintenance release where we have uplifted the underlying frameworks/tools, improved functionalities and fixed bugs. In this release, we were also able to get rid of Graphviz (see https://graphviz.gitlab.io) as we can now generate “dot graphs” directly in Java. Therefore, the installation of this tool is optional and not anymore required. However, Graphviz is the fastest way for generating diagrams and can still be used if this is an important aspect for you.

## Installation Prerequisites
