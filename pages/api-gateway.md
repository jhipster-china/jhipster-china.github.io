# <i class="fa fa-exchange"></i> JHipster API 网关

JHipster 可以用来创建 API 网关应用。一个网关应用是一个普通的 JHipster 应用，
所以你可以使用常规的 JHipster 选项及一些开发在这类应用上，
 同时它还扮演者微服务入口的角色。举例来说，它能提供 HTTP 路由、负载均衡、quality of service、安全、以及 所有微服务的 API 文档。

When the gateways and the microservices are launched, they will register themselves in the registry (using the `eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone` key in the `src/main/resources/config/application.yml` file).

The gateway will automatically proxy all requests to the microservices, using their application name: for example, when microservices `app1` is registered, it is available on the gateway on the `/app1` URL.

For example, if your gateway is running on `localhost:8080`, you could point to [http://localhost:8080/app1/rest/foos](http://localhost:8080/app1/rest/foos) to
get the `foos` resource served by microservice `app1`. If you're trying to do this with your Web browser, don't forget REST resources are secured by default in JHipster, so you need to send the correct JWT header (see the point on security below), or remove the security on those URLs in the microservice's `MicroserviceSecurityConfiguration` class.

If there are several instances of the same service running, the gateway will get those instances from the JHipster Registry, and will:

- Load balance HTTP requests using [Netflix Ribbon](https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon).
- Provide a circuit breaker using [Netflix Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/hystrix), so that failed instances are quickly and safely removed.

Each gateway has a specific "admin > gateway" menu, where opened HTTP routes and microservices instances can be monitored.

## <a name="security"></a> 安全

### JWT (JSON Web Token)

JWT (JSON Web Token) is an industry standard, easy-to-use method for securing applications in a microservices architecture.

JHipster uses the [JJWT library](https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt), provided by Okta, for implementing JWT.

Tokens are generated by the gateway, and sent to the underlying microservices: as they share a common secret key, microservices are able to validate the token, and authenticate users using that token.

Those tokens are self-sufficient: they have both authentication and authorization information, so microservices do not need to query a database or an external system. This is important in order to ensure a scalable architecture.

For security to work, a JWT secret token must be shared between all applications.

- For each application the default token is unique, and generated by JHipster. It is stored in the `.yo-rc.json` file.
- Tokens are configured with the `jhipster.security.authentication.jwt.secret` key in the `src/main/resources/config/application.yml` file.
- To share this key between all your applications, copy the key from your gateway to all the microservices, or share it using the JHipster Registry's Spring Config Server.
- A good practice is to have a different key in development and production.

### OAuth2

This feature is currently in **BETA** and thus its documentation is not yet complete.

JHipster provides the option to generate a "UAA" (User Account and Authentication) server, based on Spring Security. This server provides OAuth2 tokens for securing the gateway.

You will find all UAA-related information on our specific <a href="/using-uaa/">Using UAA for Microservice Security documentation page</a>.

Then, the gateway uses Spring Security's JWT implementation to send JWT tokens to the microservices.

## <a name="documentation"></a> 自动生成文档

The gateway exposes the Swagger API definitions of the services it proxifies so you can benefit from all useful tools like Swagger UI and swagger-codegen.

The "admin > API" menu of a gateway has a specific drop-down list, showing the gateway's API and all the APIs from the registered microservices.

Using this drop-down list, all microservices APIs are automatically documented, and testable from the gateway.

When using a secured API, security tokens are automatically added to the Swagger UI interface, so all requests work out-of-the-box.

## <a name="rate_limiting"></a> 限速

This is an advanced feature that uses [Bucket4j](https://github.com/vladimir-bukhtoyarov/bucket4j) and [Hazelcast](https://hazelcast.com/) to provide quality of service on microservices.

网关可以提供限速功能，REST 请求的数量可以被限制为：

- 根据 IP 地址 (匿名用户)
- 根据用户登入 (登入用户)

JHipster 使用 [Bucket4j](https://github.com/vladimir-bukhtoyarov/bucket4j) 和 [Hazelcast](https://hazelcast.com/) 来计算请求次数，并且会在达到限制时发送 HTTP 429 (请求过多)。默认的限制是每个用户每小时 100,000 次 API 调用。

This is an important feature, to protect a microservice architecture from being flooded by a specific user's requests.

As the gateway secures the REST endpoints, it has full access to the user's security information, so it can be easily extended to provide specific rate limits depending on the user's security roles.

To enable rate limiting, open up the `application-dev.yml` or `application-prod.yml` file and set `enabled` to `true`:

    jhipster:
        gateway:
            rate-limiting:
                enabled: true

Data is stored in Hazelcast, so it is possible to scale gateways as long as the Hazelcast distributed cache is configured, which should work out-of-the-box:

- 所有的网关，默认配置使用 Hazelcast
- 如果使用 [JHipster Registry]({{ site.url }}/jhipster-registry/), all instances of a gateway should automatically register themselves in a distributed cache

If you want to add more rules, or modify the existing rules, you need to code them in the `RateLimitingFilter` class. Examples of modifications could be:

- Lowering the limit of HTTP calls
- Adding limits per minute or per day
- Removing all limits for "admin" users

## <a name="acl"></a> 访问控制策略

By default all registered microservices are available through the gateway. If you want to exclude a specific API from being exposed through the gateway, you can use the gateway's specific access control policy filter. It is configurable using the `jhipster.gateway.authorized-microservices-endpoints` key in the `application-*.yml` files:

    jhipster:
        gateway:
            authorized-microservices-endpoints: # Access Control Policy, if left empty for a route, all endpoints will be accessible
                app1: /api,/v2/api-docs # recommended dev configuration

For example, if you only want the `/api/foo` endpoint of microservice `bar` to be available:

    jhipster:
        gateway:
            authorized-microservices-endpoints:
                bar: /api/foo
