# <i class="fa fa-flask"></i> 应用属性 (property) 配置说明

JHipster generates a Spring Boot application, and can be configured using the standard Spring Boot properties mechanism.

Those properties are configured at generation-time by JHipster, and often have different values in development and production modes: learn more about this in our [Profiles documentation]({{ site.url }}/profiles/).

In a JHipster application, there are three kinds of properties:

1. [Spring Boot 标准属性](#1)
2. [JHipster 属性](#2)
3. [应用专有的属性](#3)

## <a name="1"></a> Spring Boot 标准属性

JHipster 应用就是 Spring Boot 应用，所以你可以配置任何标准的 [Spring Boot 应用属性](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html).

## <a name="2"></a> JHipster 属性

JHipster 提供了一些属性，服务于 [JHipster 服务端库](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster)。这些属性是所有 JHipster 项目的标准属性，但是其中一部分也依赖于你在构建项目时选择的组件，举例来说：`jhipster.cache.hazelcast` 属性只有在你选择了 Hazelcast 作为 Hibernate 二级缓存的时候才有效。

这些属性实现在类 `io.github.jhipster.config.JHipsterProperties` 里。

这里有一个这些属性的说明：

    jhipster:

        # 异步调用的线程池
        async:
            core-pool-size: 2 # 初始化池大小
            max-pool-size: 50 # 最大池大小
            queue-capacity: 10000 # 池的 Queue 容量

        # Specific configuration for JHipster gateways
        # See https://www.jhipster.tech/api-gateway/ for more information on JHipster gateways
        gateway:
            rate-limiting:
                enabled: false # Rate limiting is disabled by default

                duration-in-seconds: 3_600 # By default the rate limiting is reinitialized every hour
            authorized-microservices-endpoints: # Access Control Policy, if left empty for a route, all endpoints will be accessible

## <a name="3"></a> 应用专有的属性

Your generated application can also have its own Spring Boot properties. This is highly recommended, as it allows type-safe configuration of the application, as well as auto-completion and documentation within an IDE.

JHipster has generated a `ApplicationProperties` class in the `config` package, which is already preconfigured, and it is already documented at the bottom the `application.yml`, `application-dev.yml` and `application-prod.yml` files. All you need to do is code your own specific properties.
