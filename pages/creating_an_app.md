# <i class="fa fa-rocket"></i> 创建应用

_**请查看我们的 [视频教程]({{ site.url }}/video-tutorial/) 来学习创建 JHipster 应用**_

1. [快速上手](#1)
2. [创建应用的各选项](#2)
3. [命令行选项](#3)
4. [小提示](#4)

## <a name="1"></a> 快速上手

首先，创建一个空的目录来放你的项目：

`mkdir myapplication`

进入目录：

`cd myapplication/`

开始创建项目，输入命令：

`jhipster`

Answer the questions asked by the generator to create an application tailored to your needs. Those options are described in [the next section](#2).

一旦项目创建完成，你可以使用 Maven（Linux/MacOS/Windows PowerShell 上执行 `./mvnw`，在 Windows Cmd 里执行 `mvnw`） 或 Gradle (在 Linux/MacOS/Windows PowerShell 上执行 `./gradlew`，在 Windows Cmd 里执行 `gradlew`).

应用启动在： [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

**重要** 如果你希望使用 "动态加载" JavaScript/TypeScript 代码的功能，你需要执行 `gulp` (JavaScript/AngularJS 1) 或 `yarn start` (TypeScript/Angular 2+). You can go to the [Using JHipster in development]({{ site.url }}/development/) page for more information.

## <a name="2"></a> 创建应用的各选项

_Some questions change depending on the previous choices you have made. For example, you won't need to configure an Hibernate cache if you didn't select an SQL database._

### Which *type* of application would you like to create? （你要创建的应用类型）

Your type of application depends on whether you wish to use a microservices architecture or not. A full explanation on microservices is [available here]({{ site.url }}/microservices-architecture/), if unsure use the default "Monolithic application".

You can either use:

*   Monolithic application: this a classical, one-size-fits-all application. It's easier to use and develop, and is our recommended default.
*   Microservice application: in a microservices architecture, this is one of the services.
*   Microservice gateway: in a microservices architecture, this is an edge server that routes and secures requests.
*   JHipster UAA server: in a microservices architecture, this is an OAuth2 authentication server that secures microservices. Refer <a href="/using-uaa/">JHipster UAA documentation</a> for more information.

### What is the base name of your application? （应用名称）

This is the name of your application.

### What is your default Java package name? （Java 包名）

Your Java application will use this as its root package. This value is stored by Yeoman so that the next time you run the generator the last value will become default. Of course you can override it by providing a new value.

### Do you want to use the JHipster Registry to configure, monitor and scale your application? （是否需要使用 JHipster Registry 来配置、监控和扩展你的应用）

The [JHipster Registry]({{ site.url }}/jhipster-registry/) is an Open Source tool used to manage your application at runtime.

It is required when using a microservices architecture (this is why this question is only asked when generating a monolith).

### Which *type* of authentication would you like to use? （使用哪种认证）

Answers to this question depend on previous answers. For example, if you selected the [JHipster Registry]({{ site.url }}/jhipster-registry/) above, you can only use JWT authentication.

Here are all the possible options:

*   JWT authentication: use a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/), which is the default choice
*   HTTP Session Authentication: the classical session-based authentication mechanism, like we are used to do in Java (this is how most people use [Spring Security](http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/index.html)). You can use this option with Spring Social, which will enable you to use "social login" (such as Google, Facebook, Twitter): this is configured by Spring Boot's support of Spring Social.
*   OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Authentication: this uses an OpenID Connect server, like [Keycloak](http://www.keycloak.org/) or [Okta](https://www.okta.com), which handles authentication outside of the application.
*   Authentication with JHipster UAA server: this uses a <a href="/using-uaa/">JHipster UAA server</a> that must be generated separately, and which is an OAuth2 server that handles authentication outside of the application.

You can find more information on our [securing your application]({{ site.url }}/security/) page.

### Which *type* of database would you like to use? （使用哪种数据库）

You can choose between:

- No database (only available when using a [microservice application]({{ site.url }}/microservices-architecture/))
- An SQL database (H2, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Oracle), which you will access with Spring Data JPA
- [MongoDB]({{ site.url }}/using-mongodb/)
- [Cassandra]({{ site.url }}/using-cassandra/)

### Which *production* database would you like to use? （生产环境使用哪种数据库）

This is the database you will use with your "production" profile. To configure it, please modify your `src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml` file.

If you want to use Oracle, you will need to [install the Oracle JDBC driver manually]({{ site.url }}/using-oracle/).

### Which *development* database would you like to use? （开发环境使用哪种数据库）

This is the database you will use with your "development" profile. You can either use:

*   H2, running in-memory. This is the easiest way to use JHipster, but your data will be lost when you restart your server.
*   H2, with its data stored on disk. This is currently in BETA test (and not working on Windows), but this would eventually be a better option than running in-memory, as you won't lose your data upon application restart.
*   The same database as the one you chose for production: it's a bit more complex to set up, but it should be better in the end to work on the same database as the one you will use in production. This is also the best way to use liquibase-hibernate as described in [the development guide]({{ site.url }}/development/).

To configure it, please modify your `src/main/resources/config/application-dev.yml` file.

### Do you want to use Hibernate 2nd level cache? （是否使用 Hibernate 二级缓存）

[Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/) is the JPA provider used by JHipster. For performance reasons, we highly recommend you to use a cache, and to tune it according to your application's needs.
If you choose to do so, you can use either [ehcache](http://ehcache.org/) (local cache) or [Hazelcast](http://www.hazelcast.com/) (distributed cache, for use in a clustered environnement)

### Would you like to use Maven or Gradle? （使用 Maven 或 Gradle）

You can build your generated Java application either with [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) or [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/). Maven is more stable and more mature. Gradle is more flexible, easier to extend, and more hype.

### Which other technologies would you like to use? （使用哪些额外的技术）

This is a multi-select answer, to add one or several other technologies to the application. Available technologies are:

#### Social login (Google, Facebook, Twitter)（社区登入功能）

This option is only available if you selected an SQL database or a MongoDB database. It adds [Spring Social](http://projects.spring.io/spring-social/) support to JHipster, so end-users can log-in using their Google, Facebook or Twitter account.

#### API first development using swagger-codegen（API 优先开发模式，使用 swagger-codegen）

This option lets you do [API-first development]({{ site.url }}/doing-api-first-development) for your application by integrating the [Swagger-Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) into the build.

#### Search engine using ElasticSearch（搜索引擎 ElasticSearch）

[Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) will be configured using Spring Data Elasticsearch. You can find more information on our [Elasticsearch guide]({{ site.url }}/using-elasticsearch/).

#### Clustered HTTP sessions using Hazelcast（使用 Hazelcast 来设置 Http Session 集群）

By default, JHipster uses a HTTP session only for storing [Spring Security](http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/index.html)'s authentication and authorisation information. Of course, you can choose to put more data in your HTTP sessions.
Using HTTP sessions will cause issues if you are running in a cluster, especially if you don't use a load balancer with "sticky sessions".
If you want to replicate your sessions inside your cluster, choose this option to have [Hazelcast](http://www.hazelcast.com/) configured.

#### WebSockets using Spring Websocket （使用 Spring Websocket）

Websockets can be enabled using Spring Websocket. We also provide a complete sample to show you how to use the framework efficiently.

#### Asynchronous messages using Apache Kafka

Use [Apache Kafka]({{ site.url }}/using-kafka/) as a publish/subscribe message broker.

### Which *Framework* would you like to use for the client? （使用哪种客户端框架）

The client-side framework to use.

You can either use:

*   Angular version 4+
*   AngularJS version 1.x (which will be deprecated in the future)

### Would you like to use the LibSass stylesheet preprocessor for your CSS? （使用 LibSass 预处理 CSS？）

[Node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) a great solution to simplify designing CSS. To be used efficiently, you will need to run a [Gulp](http://www.gulpjs.com) server, which will be configured automatically.

### Would you like to enable internationalization support? （支持国际化？）

By default JHipster provides excellent internationalization support, both on the client side and on the server side. However, internationalization adds a little overhead, and is a little bit more complex to manage, so you can choose not to install this feature.

### Which testing frameworks would you like to use? （使用哪些测试框架）

By default JHipster provide Java unit/integration testing (using Spring's JUnit support) and JavaScript unit testing (using Karma.js). As an option, you can also add support for:

*   Performance tests using Gatling
*   Behaviour tests using Cucumber
*   Angular integration tests with Protractor

You can find more information on our ["Running tests" guide]({{ site.url }}/running-tests/).

### Would you like to install other generators from the JHipster Marketplace? （是否要从 JHipster Marketplace 上下载额外的插件）

The [JHipster Marketplace]({{ site.url }}/modules/marketplace/) is where you can install additional modules, written by third-party developers, to add non-official features to your project.

## <a name="3"></a> 命令行选项

You can also run JHipster with some optional command-line options. Reference for those options can be found by typing `jhipster app --help`.

Here are the options you can pass:

* `--help` - 输出所有选项和使用帮助
* `--skip-cache` - Do not remember prompt answers (Default: false)
* `--skip-git` - Do not add the generated project to Git automatically (Default: false)
* `--skip-install` - Do not automatically install dependencies (Default: false)
* `--skip-client` - Skip the client-side application generation, so you only have the Spring Boot back-end code generated (Default: false). This is same as running server sub-generator with `jhipster server`.
* `--skip-server` - Skip the server-side application generation, so you only have the front-end code generated (Default: false). This is same as running client sub-generator with `jhipster client`.
* `--skip-user-management` - Skip the user management generation, both on the back-end and on the front-end (Default: false)
* `--i18n` - Disable or enable i18n when skipping client side generation, has no effect otherwise (Default: true)
* `--auth` - Specify the authentication type when skipping server side generation, has no effect otherwise but mandatory when using `skip-server`
* `--db` - Specify the database when skipping server side generation, has no effect otherwise but mandatory when using `skip-server`
* `--with-entities` - Regenerate the existing entities if they were already generated (using their configuration in the `.jhipster` folder) (Default: false)
* `--skip-checks` - Skip the check of the required tools (Default: false)
* `--jhi-prefix` - Add prefix before services, components and state/route names (Default: jhi)
* `--npm` - Use NPM instead of Yarn (Default: false)

## <a name="4"></a> 小提示

If you are an advanced user you can use our client and server sub-generators by running `jhipster client --[options]` and `jhipster server --[options]`.
Run the above sub-generators with `--help` flag to view all the options that can be passed.

You can also use the Yeoman command-line options, like `--force` to automatically overwrite existing files. So if you want to regenerate your whole application, including its entities, you can run `jhipster --force --with-entities`.
