# <i class="fa fa-usd"></i> Sponsors

JHipster uses [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/generator-jhipster) to gather money. This money is used to cover project expenses (like running this website) in a transparent way ([See the OpenCollective documentation](https://opencollective.com/learn-more)), and your donation will help the project live and grow successfully.

Please go to our [OpenCollective page](https://opencollective.com/generator-jhipster) to become a backer or a sponsor.

## Benefits of being a backer

Backers donate $2 per month to the project, and get the following benefits:

- Visibility on the front page of [https://www.jhipster.tech](https://www.jhipster.tech) in the "backers" section (about 110,000 views/month on January, 2018).
- Visibility on the GitHub main project page in the "backers" section (about 15,000 views/month on January, 2018).
- "Thank you" tweet from [@java_hipster](https://twitter.com/java_hipster).

## Benefits of being a bronze sponsor

Bronze sponsors donate $100 per month to the project, and get the following benefits:

- Visibility on the front page of [https://www.jhipster.tech](https://www.jhipster.tech) in the "sponsors" section (about 110,000 views/month on January, 2018).
- Visibility on the GitHub main project page in the "sponsors" section (about 15,000 views/month on January, 2018).
- "Thank you" tweet from [@java_hipster](https://twitter.com/java_hipster).

## Benefits of being a silver sponsor

Silver sponsors donate $500 per month to the project, and get the following benefits:

- Same benefits as bronze sponsors (visibility on main pages, and thank you tweet).
- 1 "hipster ticket": you can raise one issue per year, which will be labelled with the ["$ sponsor" label](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22%24+sponsor%22+). That issue will then be given the highest possible priority by the JHipster core dev team, within reason. If needed, we will also do a specific patch release for you.

## Benefits of being a gold sponsor

Gold sponsors donate $1000 per month to the project, and get the following benefits:

- Same benefits as silver sponsors (visibility on main pages, and thank you tweet).
- 3 "hipster tickets" per year (instead of 1 for silver sponsors).
- Company logos on all [https://www.jhipster.tech](https://www.jhipster.tech) page footers (about 550,000 views/month on January, 2018).

## What will the project do with the money?

As you can read in [the OpenCollective documentation](https://opencollective.com/learn-more), the way your money will be used will be public and totally transparent.

Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.

Money will first be used to cover direct project costs:

- Website hosting
- Developer tooling

Then, money will be used to:

- Pay for project goodies
- Pay Meetup fees
- Pay expenses for developer gatherings: travel & food expenses for core team meetings

And if we have enough money, we might in the future give "bug bounties" to developers who correct major bugs, add impressive new features, or fix "hipster tickets" that were raised by silver and gold sponsors.
